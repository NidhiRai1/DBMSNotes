// FUNCTION DEPENDENCY A -> B 
A (ATTRIBUTE OE SET OF ATTRIBUTE) IS DETERMINANT AMD B IS DEPENDENT 
IT IS THE RELATION B/W PRIMERYBKEY ATTRIBUTE AND OTHER ATTRIBUTES OF THE RELATION

//TYPE OF FUNCTIONAL DEPENDENCY
1. TRIVEL F.D --- A->  AND B IS THE SYBSET OF A
2.NON - TRIVAL F.D ----- A-> B AND B IS NOT THE SUBSET OF A OR NULL INTERSECTION

//REULES OF F.D
REFLEXIVE --- IF B IS THE SUBSET OF A THEN A-> B 
AGGUMENTATION --IF X-> B AND R(X, Y, Z) ARE ATTRBUTE THEN XZ -> YZ
TRANSIVITY --- IF A -> B AND B -> C THEN A-> C

//NORMlization - it is use to reduce the redundency from the data, because  redundency bring three annomalis (

annomolis are ;-
1.INSERTION ANNOMALIES - STUDENT ARE ENROLLED BUT NOT GET IN THEIR COURSES YET SO THAT PART IS NULL FOR NOW CAUSE INSERTION 
ANNOMALIY IN THE DATA 
2.DELETION ANNOMALIES -  ONLY ONE STUDENT OD ME IN THE COLLEGE IF YOU DELETE THAT STUDENT THAT ENIRE COURSE GOT LOST FROM 
THE COLLEGE CAUSE DATA REDUNDENCY
3. UPDATION ANNOMALIES - LET'S HOD CHAMGE FROM THE ECE DEPARTMENT THEN YOU HAVE TO GO IN EACH STUDENT HOD SECTION AND UPDATE  , H
ERE U NEED ONLY ONE UPDATE BUT WE R UPDATING AT MULITPLE LOACTION COZ OF DATA REDUNDENCY
**DB SIZE INCREASE DUE TO THES ANNOMALISES
THESE ANNOMALISE GOT OPTIMISED BY NORMALISATION 

//WHAT WE DO IN NORMALIZATION 
WE DECOMOPSE THE TABLE INTO MULTIPLE TABLES  TILL SRP (SINGLE RESPOSIBLITY PRINCIPLE) ACHIVED

//TYPE OF NORMALIZATIONS 
1. 1NF - EVERY RELATIONAL CELL HAS ATOMATIC VALUE AND RELATION DO NOT NAVE  MULTI - VALUED ATTRIBUTE
2, 2NF - RELATION MUST BE 1NF , AND THEIR SHOULD NOT BE ANY PARTIAL DEPENDENCY ALL NON PRIMEATTRIBUTE 
DEPEND FULLY ON PRIME ATTRIBUTE
EG - R(A , B , C, D) WHERE A , B TOGETHER A PRIMERY KEY SO IF B -> C THEN IT'S A PARTIAL DEPENDENCY 
SOLUTION DIVIDE IT INTO TWO RELATION R(A , B , D) WHERE AB -> D AND R(B ,C ) WHERE B -> C 2NF
3.3NF - RELATION MUST BE 2NF , AND ALL NON - PRIME ATTRIBUTE SHOULD NOT FIND A NON - PRIME ATTRIBUTE
EG - R(A , B, C) WHERE A IS PRIME ATTRIBUTE AND IF B -> C WHICH IS NON - PRIME ATTRIBUTE DEPENDING ON NON - P
RIME ATTRIBUTE THAT CREAT REDUNDENCY OF DATA
RESOLVED - R1(A , B) WHER PK IS A AND R2(B , C) WHERE PK IS B AND A -> B AND B -> C
4, BCNF(BOYCE - COTT NORMAL FORM) - RELATION MUST BE 3NF AND IF A-> B THEN A IS A SUPER KEY I.E DEPENDENT (RIGHT HAND SIDE ) WON'T BE PRIME 


 //adavatages of normalisation 
no redundency , no annomalies , data base faster and greater overall data base organisation
